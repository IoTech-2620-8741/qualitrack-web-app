/**
 * Represents an authenticated user within the Identity and Access Management domain.
 *
 * @remarks
 * In Domain-Driven Design, User is an entity because it has a stable identity
 * represented by its numeric identifier. This entity stores the minimum user
 * information required by the frontend to manage authentication state,
 * authorization checks, and session context.
 *
 * The roles collection determines which application areas and bounded contexts
 * the user can access after authentication.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const user = new User({
 *   id: 1,
 *   username: 'qa.manager',
 *   roles: ['ROLE_QA_MANAGER']
 * });
 *
 * console.log(user.username); // 'qa.manager'
 * ```
