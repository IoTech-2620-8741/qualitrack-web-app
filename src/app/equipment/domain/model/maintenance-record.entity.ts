 * Represents a maintenance record within the equipment management domain.

 * This entity stores information about a maintenance activity performed on
 * a specific equipment. It includes the maintenance date, responsible technician,
 * description of the work performed, maintenance type, and creation date.
 *
 * In a domain-driven design context, MaintenanceRecord is an entity because
 * each record has a unique identity and represents a specific maintenance event
 * in the lifecycle of an equipment.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const record = new MaintenanceRecord({
 * id: 1,
 * equipmentId: 101,
 * maintenanceDate: '2026-05-12',
 * technicianName: 'John Doe',
 * description: 'Preventive maintenance and calibration performed.',
 * type: 'PREVENTIVE',
 * createdAt: '2026-05-12T10:00:00Z'
 * });
 *
 * console.log(record.technicianName); // 'John Doe'
 * ```
