/**
 * Represents a command used to configure a BPM parameter for a specific equipment.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This command contains the required data to define the acceptable operating
 * range of a parameter associated with an equipment. It is typically used
 * in the application layer to request the creation or registration of a BPM
 * parameter configuration.
 *
 * The command does not represent a domain entity by itself. Instead, it carries
 * the input data needed to execute a use case related to BPM parameter setup.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const command: ConfigureBpmCommand = {
 *   equipmentId: 101,
 *   parameterName: 'Temperature',
 *   minValue: 20,
 *   maxValue: 80,
 *   unit: '°C'
 * };
 * ```
