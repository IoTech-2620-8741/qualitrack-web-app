/**
 * Represents the intention to officially release a production batch after successful quality control.
 *
 * @remarks
 * In a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture, this Command belongs to the application layer.
 * It encapsulates the necessary parameters to execute the release of a batch, acting as a
 * strict boundary contract for the use case. Releasing a batch indicates that it has passed
 * all required testing and meets Good Manufacturing Practices (BPM/GMP) for distribution or use.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const command: ReleaseBatchCommand = {
 *  batchId: 101,
 *  releaseDate: '2026-10-05T11:30:00Z',
 *  notes: 'All final quality control tests passed. Product meets pH and viscosity standards. Approved for distribution.'
 * };
 *
 * await releaseBatchUseCase.execute(command);
 * ```
