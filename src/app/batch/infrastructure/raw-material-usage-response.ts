/**
 * Resource representation of a raw material usage record for API communication.
 *
 * @remarks
 * In a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture, this interface serves as an
 * infrastructure-level data contract. It represents the state of a raw
 * material consumption record as it is serialized for HTTP communication, entirely
 * stripped of internal domain logic or behaviors. Resources act as a
 * strict boundary, preventing domain entities from leaking directly into external
 * API layers.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const resource: RawMaterialUsageResource = {
 *   id: 1,
 *   batchId: 101,
 *   rawMaterialId: 45,
 *   rawMaterialName: 'Purified Water',
 *   quantityUsed: 150.5,
 *   unit: 'liters',
 *   usageDate: '2026-10-05T09:30:00Z',
 *   createdAt: '2026-10-05T09:35:00Z'
 * };
 *
 * ```

/**
 * Response envelope for raw material usage collection queries.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This interface defines the structure of API responses that return multiple
 * raw material usage records. Utilizing an envelope pattern allows for
 * consistent metadata handling (such as pagination or status flags inherited from
 * BaseResponse) across all collection endpoints within the application's
 * infrastructure layer.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const apiResponse: RawMaterialUsagesResponse = {
 *  rawMaterialUsages: [
 *    { id: 1, rawMaterialName: 'Solvent A', ... },
 *    { id: 2, rawMaterialName: 'Active Ingredient B', ... }
 *  ]
 * };
