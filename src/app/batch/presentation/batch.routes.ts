/**
 * Routing of Product Batch Management.
 *
 * @remarks
 * `/batches` lists every batch of the laboratory and `/batches/environments` opens the production environment
 * whose products are shown. Products and batches are addressed inside an environment, mirroring
 * /api/v1/laboratories/{laboratoryId}/environments/{environmentId}/products/{productId}/batches.
 * Links that only know the batch id (`/batches/:batchId`) resolve the full path. The view-named paths used
 * before semantic routes redirect to their new address.
 *
 * Registering a batch is guarded by the operator guard; releasing and rejecting are restricted to quality
 * managers inside their own views.
