 * - empty path: active alerts of an environment (US85).
 * - `history`: every alert of an environment, filtered by status and severity (TS74).
 * - `notification-settings`: notification preferences of the signed-in user.
 * - `:alertId`: detail of the deviation alert with that numeric id, in a panel over the active alerts (US86).
 *
 * The view-named paths used before semantic routes redirect to their new address; e-mails sent by the
 * platform still link to `deviation-detail/:id`.
